# mwwm
A Mod/Fork of weston to make it usable as a DE.
To install you will need: a wayland capable system, and I will recommend a 1080p screen which is what I am making this on.
this will be released soon, so pls stop by and tell me if there are errors.
# WARNING THIS IS NOT COMPLETE AND IT IS VERY BUGGY I RECOMMEND HAVING A BACKUP WM!
The minimize I will remove because it makes it so you can't get it back. have Fun!
 # releases
   you can get it by running `git clone https://github.com/0xECoder/mwwm/`
